        What’s a PhD?
    </strong></div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-half">
        PhD students are students who have completed basic training (e.g. during Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees) who are now conducting research! Typically, PhD candidates might take some classes at the start of their PhD, but mostly they dedicate their time to research and teaching. PhD students typically get paid in the form of Research Assistantships or Teaching Assistantships, and their compensation includes their tuition, their health insurance, and a living stipend. PhD students become PhD candidates after passing their general exam, typically around their third year, and graduate after completing their dissertation thereafter.

        Applying as a PhD student to Machine Agency
    </strong></div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-half">
        We are always looking for creative, technical, hardworking, and collaborative PhD applicants. Applicants are expected to have a strong interest in digital fabrication, (small-scale/laboratory) automation, human-centered robotics, open-source hardware, and science and technology studies. Successful applicants have demonstrated skill in design and engineering, including in computer programming, mechanical design, interaction design, architecture, electrical engineering, or product design. Writing and presentation skills are essential, as PhD students are expected to regularly publish in and present to diverse venues.

        Visiting Researchers
    </strong></div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-half">
        Machine Agency has limited space for self-funded visiting PhD students from other universities. Visiting PhD students might come to the Agency for a quarter or two to collaborate on a research project that is of mutual interest.

        Getting Research Experience at Machine Agency as a UW Student
    </strong></div>
    <div class="padding-bottom-half">
        Machine Agency runs several Directed Research Groups (DRGs) where undergraduates and master’s students can gain research experience for academic credits. For current offerings and application processes, see <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/peek">here</a>. For examples of prior DRGs see <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/research/archives/peek"> our archive</a>. If you are currently a UW student interested in a DRG, feel free to reach out to Prof. Nadya or other Machine Agents for more information.
